# Graphs-and-Dijkstras-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
This is CS202 Homework Assignment 4 of Bilkent University.

This involves C++ codes and a report regarding Graph structures and related algorithms such as Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. It also includes some questions regarding 2-3-4 trees and heap structures.

I would like to thank to my friend, Mr. Berk Güler, for his consultation. This project is assigned by Prof. Dr. Aynur Dayanık.
